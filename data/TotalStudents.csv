Footnotes:
1,All counts are randomly rounded to a multiple of 3 using the following procedure: counts which are already a multiple of 3 are not adjusted; counts one greater than a multiple of 3 are adjusted to the next lowest multiple of 3 with a probability of two-thirds and to the next highest multiple of 3 with a probability of one-third. The probabilities are reversed for counts that are one less than a multiple of 3.
2,The data are subject to revision.
3,"Enrolments are based on students enrolled in the postsecondary institutions at the time of the fall snapshot date, that is, a single date chosen by the institution which falls from September 30th to December 1st . Therefore students who are not enrolled during this time period are excluded and enrolment totals do not represent a full academic year. This has a greater impact on Colleges as they have a continuous intake of students and shorter programs. It should also be noted, enrolments are based on program counts and not student counts. If a student is enrolled in more than one program as of the snapshot date, then all of their programs are included in the count."
4,"Up to 2008, the enrolment count excludes students enrolled in programs related to pre-employment, apprenticeship, basic training or skills upgrading, second language training, job readiness or orientation programs. However, as of 2009 the enrolment count includes these programs but still excludes apprenticeship programs."
5,"From 2005 to 2008, the enrolments for the University of Regina are not available."
6,"In 2008/2009, two colleges in Alberta became universities."
7,"In 2008/2009, five colleges in British Columbia became universities."
8,UNESCO's International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) is the reference classification for organising education programmes and related qualifications by education levels and fields. The basic concepts and definitions of ISCED are intended to be internationally valid and comprehensive of the full range of education systems. Data in this table are based on ISCED 2011.
9,"The Primary Groupings of the Classification of Instructional Programs for enrolments and graduates are adapted from the 2011 Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP), Statistics Canada's standard for the classification of instructional programs."
10,The immigration status variable has been renamed student status to better reflect the elements covered by that variable.
11,"Beginning with the 2008/2009 reporting year, the data extraction methodology to populate Alberta's PSIS submission was updated by Alberta Advanced Education to provide more accurate reporting."
12,"Beginning with the 2015/2016 reporting year, the PSIS enrolment data for Ontario colleges were submitted by the Ontario Ministry of Advanced Education and Skills Development to provide more consistent data reporting across the province."
